# Welcome!

By day, I am a humble hacker, but by night, I transform into a... not-so-humble hacker and spinner of tall tales. Or so I like to think. If you wish to learn more about me, head on over to the [about](#about) page and I will try to keep things interesting.

Otherwise, on with the show!

p.s. There's honestly not too much of a show yet right now. Also, if you happen to stumble upon this site, expect stuff to change abruptly since I am still experimenting on this shit.
