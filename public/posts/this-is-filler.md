# This is Filler

Ah, yes, it is time for some filler

I have no ideas, so it's time for filler!

Just keyboard diarrhoea, with no filter

I've stated the case, don't go out of kilter

A mere centiword, grist for the miller

That almost made sense, I am so killer

Eh, no, it didn't, gotta keep it realer

My brain, it hurts, get me a healer

Why rhyme at all, is it mere concealer?

Got to close this up, get me a sealer

The body is lost, can't prove that I killed her

The rear of the post, at least I filled her
