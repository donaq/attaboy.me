# Love, Continued

Yesterday, I wrote a little about my [views](http://attaboy.me/#posts/blag/5) on marriage, but I did not say much about love. I tend to approach most things logically, and I approached the issue of love no differently. First, my basic premises.

1. If you love someone, you want them to be happy.

2. Falling in love with someone is a joyful process.

3. An overall increase on the total amount of happiness within any group of people that does not come as a result of hurting anyone else is to be desired.

Therefore, polyamory is the only logical way to love.

Let me explain how I came to my conclusion. It follows from (1) and (2) that if you object to someone you love doing something that gives them happiness, then your objection does not have its roots in love. After all, if you love someone, why would you begrudge them more happiness? In any other scenario, most people would agree with this, but when we talk about the person you love loving people other than yourself, people tend to become rather irrational. I suppose you could argue that you would be unhappy, and hence that scenario would cause the total amount of happiness between you, the one you love and the third party to decrease. In that case, and provided the person you love doesn't stop loving you, maybe you should ask yourself why you're unhappy about the person you love getting a little extra happiness, because your being irrationally unhappy is the only reason why the total unhappiness could decrease.

Don't get me wrong, I do not believe in cheating. I think there should be honesty in a relationship. So if you're going to love more than one person, they should all know. Also, I do not believe in unfairness. If the relationship is not going to be exclusive, then it should not be exclusive for any party in the relationship. I think human society would be much better off if there were more love rather than less.

Having said that, I am only polyamorous in theory. This is because humans are by and large not rational. My wife is monogamous, and even though I do not believe in that, she meant enough to me that I was unwilling to give up our relationship. And since there was a conflict in our values, one of us had to compromise. I thought about the problem logically. On one hand, she could accept that I would be polyamorous, in which case:

1. Her happiness would decrease, because she is monogamous by nature.

2. Her unhappiness would make me less happy.

3. My happiness may not even increase, because I am unlikely to find someone who matters as much to me as she does.

On the other hand, I could agree to be monogamous:

1. We remain as happy as we are now, which is very. Unless at some point it stops working, but as I have said in the previous post, we can work at it.

2. I give up any potential additional happiness I might derive from loving other people.

Put like that, my choice was pretty obvious. I made the rational decision, and I have not had cause for regret so far. I suspect this will not be relatable to most people, because most people are either generally irrational, or they are irrational about love. I do have more stuff to say about love, stuff which is more practical and relatable, and I will talk about it in the next post.
