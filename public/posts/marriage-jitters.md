# Marriage Jitters

I just stopped writing for two days and I can already feel the habit starting to slip away. It was sort of unavoidable, because I was meeting my mates, whom I have not met for a couple of months, two nights ago, and last night I was busy with Chinese New Year stuff (read: family). So tonight, even though it is now 12:48 a.m., I have decided to bang out at least 100 words before going to sleep. And now, on with tonight's main topic.

Recently, I had a conversation with a friend of mine who had just gotten engaged and was starting to get cold feet. Well, not really. I think she was still quite set on her course, but she was starting to have some misgivings. She basically voiced what was going on in my head when I was engaged a couple of years ago. _Is this the end (of the game)? Am I going to just be a boring wife now?_ She explained that she had never considered cheating before (and wasn't about to start), but that she did feel the urge to... sort of get someone else to like her so that she could know that she still "had it".

Being an utter sociopath, of course, I told her that it ain't over till the fat lady sings, and that when they'd decided on a date, then she would know the exact final moment when she could still change her mind. I also told her that if she wasn't absolutely sure that she wouldn't leave him at the altar, she should invite me to the wedding just in case so that I could take a video of her running away and post it on YouTube.

My friend is pretty funny. She sort of thinks like a man (as men are traditionally perceived). I think I had more doubts than her in the past. Before I decided to get married, I did not think it was something I wanted. I thought it was an antiquated institution that accomplishes little. If two people love one another, they would stay together regardless of whether they are married. If they have stopped loving each other, then staying together because of an institution is utterly illogical and makes no one happy. Isn't that the point of it all in the end? To be happy? It is all very confusing if you think about it logically.

In any case, I changed my mind about marriage because, unlike me, my wife did want it. It is easy to assume from what I have said so far that my marriage is thus a structure built upon shifty foundations. That assumption, however, does not take into account my devotion towards my wife, and my decision that I would either not get married, or I would be in it to win it. Yes, you motherfucking (strangely anthropomorphized) factors that cause marriages to falter and fail. I have studied you. I know your weaknesses. If you come against me, I will fight you. It may not be an easy battle, but rest assured that it is I who will emerge, bruised and bloodied perhaps, but victorious. You have been warned.

So that is my attitude towards marriage. It's all well and good, but I still got jitters before we actually moved in together. I thought that at least some parts of our relationship would get more boring after marriage. Certainly I would lose some autonomy. However, I must say that I have been pleasantly surprised by how awesome it has been so far (about 1.5 years). Don't get me wrong, my wife and I do have problems sometimes, but for the most part, we have been really happy staying together. Partially it is because, like I said, I have done some thinking about what could potentially wreck a marriage, and I actively work to head those problems off. Mostly it is because my wife is equally committed to us. And that was what I told my friend. The hope I could offer to her was that, provided your partner is as committed to the marriage as you are, it is anything but boring. Every day, you look forward to going home and seeing your favourite person in the world again.

Of course, this may all be one-sided on my part, because when I told my wife about this conversation, she told me to tell my friend the following:

> It's not that bad.

> You get used to it.

> Being boring, that is.

> You just have to work at it, day after day after day...

> You also get used to seeing the same person. Day after day after day...

Either my wife is fucking funny, or she actually really hates me. Sometimes I can't tell. I am sleeping with one eye open tonight, just in case.

Welcome to married life, anonymous friend.
