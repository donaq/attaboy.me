# Chinese New Year

I know I promised to continue my ponderous pontifications on love yesterday, but let's break for an interlude about Chinese New Year. It used to be a special time of the year for my cousins and I when we were kids. It was the one time of the year when the adults would play mahjong all night and we would be allowed to stay up late. We would play with the other kids in the neighbourhood at the void decks and playgrounds all day. We would buy sparklers and MacGuyver a rocket by tying a whole box of them together.

When we grew older and started to gain more independence and Singapore built the MRT system, we would use our student passes and take the train all the way around the island. How does one do that? Well, we started at Braddell, then went all the way to Jurong East, where we would change to the green line and go all the way to Raffles Place, and then change to the red line again and go back to Braddell. Either that or we would take a random bus and stop at the first MacDonald's we saw.

As we grew older still, we would go clubbing on 除夕 to 守岁. There is a Chinese superstition in Singapore that if you stayed up late the night before the first day of the new year, your parents would live longer. We basically used it as an excuse to party all night. Ah, the times we used to have.

Now, we are all married and some of us even have kids of our own. Not me, though, I am still footloose and fancy free. Still, most of my cousins no longer have the leisure to go out and blaze a trail of drunken destruction around the island like we used to. Furthermore, because I am married, I now have to give out ang paos to my unmarried relatives, so the love has pretty much gone out of the relationships we used to have. Now there is only hatred and the burning desire for vengeance. Which is why we play poker. I go now, in an attempt to take all my cousin's shit.

Wish me luck.
