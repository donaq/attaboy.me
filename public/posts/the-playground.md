# The Playground

The first time Melvin met her was at the playground. The bigger kids used to pick on Melvin because - well, because he was there. If he hid during recess, they sought him out and pinched him instead. Looking back from the safety of adulthood, he knew that they had no intention of hurting him. All they did was surround him at the playground and push him around, testing their strength on him. As a child, it was beyond terrifying, because he was utterly helpless, propelled unpredictably by vast forces beyond his control. He would shut his eyes, wishing for an adult to notice, wishing for recess to be over, wishing he was bigger so that they wouldn't pick on him.

And then it stopped. He would never forget that day. "Hey Melvis, it's time for the game again," Harry called. It had begun with "Melvin the pelvis", and had then been shortened for the sake of convenience.

"You don't have to go to them if you don't want to, you know," someone said from behind Melvin as he prepared to trudge to Harry and his friends. Melvin turned around and saw a thin, dark-haired little girl of about nine, looking at him seriously. Disappointed at the unlikelihood of the girl being able to actually help him, he turned back to face his tormentors. The girl clucked her tongue irritably and stopped him by grabbing his arm. He tried to shrug her off, but was somehow unable to.

"Look at these little lovebirds," Harry snorted. Then, to Melvin's horror, they started walking towards him. He froze, but the girl strode out to meet his bullies. Harry and his gang were nonplussed. "Get lost, kid," he grunted benevolently.

"If you wish to get to him, you may walk around me." She replied very quietly.

Melvin could hardly believe his ears. For a moment, everyone was frozen by surprise, and Melvin stared at the waifish girl, even smaller than he was, surrounded by five twelve-year-old boys. As the moment lengthened, Melvin began to hope that they would leave him alone today after all. _Surely_, he thought, _they wouldn't hit a girl_. However, as he saw Harry's expression of disbelief gradually replaced by the more familiar sneer, his faint hope died. Harry would not hit the girl, but neither could he just walk around her in front of his cronies, so he shoved her roughly aside instead. At least, that was what he tried to do. What actually happened was that he lost his balance while the girl remained immobile. For the second time that day, Harry's eyes widened in shock, and he stared at the girl as if seeing her for the first time. She looked back up at him, expressionless.

The other boys looked to see what their leader would do. Harry reddened, leaned forward and pushed violently with all his strength at her shoulders, but it was like slamming his palms into a concrete wall. He yelled in pain and sat back heavily on the ground. "Ow! What's wrong with you, you freak?", he shouted in anger and sudden fear. She looked down at him, still expressionless. Then, she looked around at his friends, and, Melvin noticed with glee, _they shrank back_. She looked back at the recumbent form of Harry and took one step towards him. He scrambled up from the ground and ran away, his friends in tow.

As Melvin looked on at his former tormentors, their power leached from them, he wondered how they had ever seemed so frightening to him. The girl turned and walked back towards him, but curiously, he felt no fear towards her. "How did you do that?", he asked. She cocked her head and regarded him seriously for a while, then grinned impishly but ignored his question.

"I don't think they will bother anyone here again."
