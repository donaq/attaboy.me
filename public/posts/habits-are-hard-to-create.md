# Habits are Hard to Create

The worst thing about working late is that it interferes with this habit that I am trying to build. However, I think it is only right that I prioritise work over my own leisure pursuits. After all, it is the salary from my work that allows me to buy the laptop on which I am currently writing this post. Have I already succeeded in building the habit? I think so. I do feel bad when I do not write something every day. On the other hand, if it is a day such as this, when I felt obliged to take some work home and I finished it at around 12 a.m., I feel bad too, about not writing anything interesting.

On the other other hand, writing something is better than not writing anything, because at the very least, I exercise my vocabulary and grammar. I had intended to do a scene test for my idea about vampires, but I felt that I was too tired to do it properly, so I stopped doing it halfway through. Let's hope I will be able to continue it tomorrow.
