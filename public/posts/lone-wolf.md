# Lone Wolf

This is going to be another short one because once again, it is close to midnight and I do not want to turn up at work feeling lethargic tomorrow. I actually have a [valid reason](http://attaboy.me/#posts/blag/1) to not write my 100 words today, and that is because I was held up at work earlier on. However, I think I can bang out a hundred words before going to bed.

--------------

I... actually just typed out and deleted an entire paragraph about how cool my colleagues are and how funny our lunch conversation was. They are cool, and [Nugit](http://nugit.co) is an awesome place to work, but I don't want to sound like a company man. No, I must preserve my self-image of being a sullen, anti-establishment lone wolf. I keep saying stuff like that in real life, but then I burst out laughing at myself. I think I am doing self-deprecating humour, but who knows? Maybe everyone around me just thinks I am full of shit. Who cares? I'm laughing at my own jokes, so I am funny, for at least an audience of one. A lone wolf.

I was also thinking of writing about an argument happening on my Facebook feed right now between two groups of people over some douchebag PUA who apparently advocated legalising rape in a satirical piece, but then this sort of post requires more time and I am really not that interested. I think it is a pity that both sides seem to disagree with the douchebag and all he stands for, but the argument has descended into one side calling the other misogynists and the other side replying by calling them [SJWs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Justice_Warrior). Wouldn't it be nice if decent people could all be united in their hatred of D-bags instead of being divided over how much the D-bag really deserves to be disliked? I wouldn't know, I am not really a decent person. If anything, I am like 90% D-bag myself, though nowhere near slick enough to be a PUA. 90% D-bag, 10% lone wolf. A werelonewolf, if you will.

Good night, world.
