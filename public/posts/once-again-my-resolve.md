# Once Again, My Resolve

In [that other blag](https://blag.attaboy.me), I have already explained my resolution to write 100 words a day for the purpose of honing my writing skills so that I could develop some ideas for stories that I have been thinking about forever. I made a start there, but then I hit a snag. The [platform](http://thegrid.io) ultimately proved unusable for me, but I shall not go into the reasons in detail right now. Suffice it to say that it is _very_ beta at the moment. Anyway, so the long and short of it was that I decided to get off my arse and finish hacking up [this site](http://attaboy.me) instead. I started making the [CMS](https://github.com/donaq/mdblog) for this site about a year back and, as often happens with me, I stopped doing it halfway.

Happily, I was able to treat the suckiness of The Grid and my resolution to write as motivation to actually finish something else I had started, and it feels pretty damned good! I think that alone was quite worth the money I paid for the founding member account. Besides, as I have [previously](http://attaboy.me/#about) stated, I much prefer writing Markdown in vim than using some WYSIWYG editor anyway. So, thanks for sucking, guys!

All righty, then. So, I have spent about a week finishing up this site, or rather, getting it to a usable state, during which my resolution was somewhat interrupted. So here it is, again, my resolve. I will publish at least 100 words every day here, barring work or family commitments and illness.

Why 100 words? Well, it is easily enough achievable that it can become a habit. I have set many lofty goals for myself in the past and I have failed to achieve most of them. Then I read [this article](http://markmanson.net/goals) and it made a _hell_ of a lot of sense. The idea is to take your limited willpower and focus and invest them in habits that will become second nature, i.e. when not doing them eventually makes you uncomfortable. If the habits are good ones, you basically just become a better version of yourself _by going with the flow_! I think this is an immensely powerful idea, and I invite anyone who is reading this to try it out with me.
